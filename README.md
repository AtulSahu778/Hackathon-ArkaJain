Welcome to Your Healthcare Platform Project
📋 Project Overview
This is a modern, responsive front-end for a smart and connected healthcare platform, especially tailored for rural and semi-urban communities.

🧰 Built With:
React

TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

The app is lightweight, mobile-friendly, and easy to customize, making it ideal for healthcare dashboards, doctor-patient portals, and health education systems.

🛠 How to Run the Project Locally
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
We recommend using nvm to manage Node versions easily.

🚀 Getting Started:
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-git-url>

# 2. Navigate to the project folder
cd <your-project-name>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
Once started, your app will be running locally at:
👉 http://localhost:5173 (or the default Vite port).

💡 Editing the Code
You can edit the project using any code editor — we recommend Visual Studio Code.

Open the project folder and start modifying files inside the src/ directory.
Any saved changes will auto-refresh in the browser thanks to Vite’s hot module reload.

🚢 Deployment
When you're ready to deploy the app to production, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
This will generate a dist/ folder containing the optimized production build.

You can then deploy the project using services like:

Vercel

Netlify

Render

Or your preferred hosting platform

🌐 Custom Domain
After deployment, you can connect a custom domain via your hosting platform’s dashboard (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
Most platforms provide step-by-step guides for setting this up.
